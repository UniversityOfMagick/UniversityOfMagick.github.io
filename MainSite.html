<big><big><big><big><strong> Welcome to Formali's School of Magick and Witchcraft! </strong></big></big></big></big>
</p>

<p align="center"> <br /> 
<big><big> Hello and welcome! This site will teach you witchcraft and will take you from a beginner to an expert! Always remember though, <br />
                    in witchcraft, you will always be a student, there will always be something else to learn. This online school's goal is to take you <br />
                    from a beginning level to an advanced level. If you are very knowledgeable in the craft, you will start out in the advanced teachings, <br />
                    while on the other hand, if you are a beginner, then you will be placed in the beginner levels.

<big><big> There will classes on Alchemy, Spell Casting, Rituals, Wtich History, Witch Philosiphy, and etc. You will be required to pass all of these <br />
                    classes in order to stay within the program (if you fail, you get kicked out). There will be online group classes as well as just written online <br />
                    classes. All Books will be available digitally or if you would like to have hard copies to keep with you and to study in, you can order the books <br />
                    from this site. They aren't as expensive as college books before you think this is just a scam, tutition is also free until you complete one full <br />
                    semester, then the tuition fee goes to 14.99$ a month. LIKE I SAID THOUGH, you get to try a full semester free just to see how you like it <br/>
                    before you start paying tuition (We have to make money to keep the school going). When you sign up, someone will message you through <br/>
                    email, telling you how the site works and where to find beginner lessons. You will also get an email about upcoming quizes and tests <br/>
                    and their due dates.

<big><big> What you will learn in this site will be true Magick and Witchcraft knowledge, stuff you can't find by just going to sites like, "FreeWitchInfo.scam". <br/>
                    You will be taught properly vizualization, meditation, and etc at the beginner level. You will learn about the witches pyramid, how a witch <br/>
                    should conduct themselves, and how to practice the craft with care. You will learn all these things and more with this school. <br/>
                    This school teaches in the arts of both white and black magick, you will learn how both work, but you will have to choose which <br/>
                    one you will practice. Both magick arts will be taught by different teachers, each one specializing in either black or white magick. <br/>
                    This school will teach you first and foremost to be a scholar, rather than some kind of movie super witch that can blow up <br/>
                    buildings with the snap of their fingers.
